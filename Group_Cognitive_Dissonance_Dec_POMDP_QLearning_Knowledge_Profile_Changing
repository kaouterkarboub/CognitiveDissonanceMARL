"""

In this scenario, each individual in the group would be modeled as an agent with a set of beliefs or attitudes about climate change. The group's goal would be to reduce their collective cognitive dissonance by achieving a shared understanding and belief about climate change.

The input to the Dec-POMDP would be the searches of the group members on Google Trends about climate change. This data would be used to estimate the beliefs and attitudes of each agent regarding climate change. Additionally, the cognitive dissonance of each agent would be modeled as a variable that changes after every exposure to knowledge.
